Project Roadmap: Python Quiz
1. Plan the Basics
Goal: A console-based quiz where users answer multiple-choice questions on Python knowledge.

Decide on the number of questions: We decided as a group that we would develop 15-20 questions. (THIS IS DONE)

Question format: Each has a question, 4 options, and a correct answer. (THIS IS DONE)

Scoring: +1 for correct, 0 for wrong. 17-20 points = Excellent. 12-17 points = Good. 7-12 points = Needs Improvement. 0-7 points = Fail (THIS HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED INTO OUR CODE)

2. Organize Our Data
Task: Store quiz questions in a structured format. (THIS IS DONE)

To Do: #THIS WEEK WE WILL BE CREATING OUR CODE AND MAKING THE CORRECT CHANGES NEEDED#

Use a list of dictionaries: (THIS IS DONE)

python
Copy
Edit
questions = [
    {
        "question": "What is the output of print(2**3)?",
        "options": ["5", "6", "8", "9"],
        "answer": "8" },
    # more questions...]
 3. Build the Quiz Logic
Task: Display questions and collect user input.

To Do:

Use a loop to go through each question. (THIS IS DONE)

Show question and options. (THIS IS DONE)

Get and validate user input (a, b, c, or d).

Check if the answer is correct.

Keep score.

 4. Add Feedback and Score
Task: Show correct/incorrect and final result. (THIS IS DONE)

To Do:

Show feedback after each question. (WE WILL NOT ADD FEEDBACK AFTER EACH QUESTION)

Display the final score at the end. (THIS HAS BEEN ADDED TO OUR CODE)

 5. Clean Up the User Interface
Task: Improve readability.

To Do:

Add line breaks. (WE HAVE ADDED THIS TO OUR CODE)

Number the questions.

Clear or separate each question visually.
 6. (Optional) Add Features (WE WILL NOT BE ADDING THIS ON TO OUR CODE)

***TAYLOR, ALIEHSA,DANNY, AND MICHAEL WENT AHEAD AND ADDED 4 OR MORE QUESTIONS INTO THE CODE EACH***

Randomize question order.

Add categories (e.g., Basics, Functions, Loops).

Build a GUI using Tkinter or a web version with Flask.

Started Power Point presentation for team mates to add to.
Added Power Point slide to README.md to better explain our version and outcome.
Came up with an additional 4 questions to add to the quiz that I thought would be great additions.
