Project Roadmap: Multiple Choice Python Quiz
🧠 1. Plan the Basics
Goal: Console-based quiz where users answer multiple-choice questions.

Decide on the number of questions.

Questions format: Each has a question, 4 options, and a correct answer.

Scoring: +1 for correct, 0 for wrong.

🗂️ 2. Organize Your Data
Task: Store quiz questions in a structured format.

✅ To Do:

Use a list of dictionaries:

python
Copy
Edit
questions = [
    {
        "question": "What is the output of print(2**3)?",
        "options": ["5", "6", "8", "9"],
        "answer": "8"
    },
    # more questions...
]
💻 3. Build the Quiz Logic
Task: Display questions and collect user input.

✅ To Do:

Use a loop to go through each question.

Show question and options.

Get and validate user input (a, b, c, or d).

Check if answer is correct.

Keep score.

🧪 4. Add Feedback and Score
Task: Show correct/incorrect and final result.

✅ To Do:

Show feedback after each question.

Display final score at the end.

🧼 5. Clean Up the User Interface
Task: Improve readability.

✅ To Do:

Add line breaks.

Number the questions.

Clear or separate each question visually.

🌟 6. (Optional) Add Features
Here’s where you can get creative:

Timer for each question.

Load questions from a .json or .csv file.

Randomize question order.

Show explanations after answers.

Add categories (e.g., Basics, Functions, Loops).

Build a GUI using Tkinter or a web version with Flask.
